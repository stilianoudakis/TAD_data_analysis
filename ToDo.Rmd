# List of topics to review and methods to explore

### 05/11/18

* Explore the relationship between TAD boundaries and subcompartment intervals using logistic regression

* Set up the equation as follows: $Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}A +\beta_{2}B$, where Y represents whether there was an overlap bwtween a flanked TAD boundary and a subcompartment (A or B).

* We use a logistic regression model set up: $logit[\pi(x)] = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}A +\beta_{2}B$, where $\pi(x) = P(Y=1)$ at values x=(A,B).

* Attempt to incorporate distance:
    + Left
    + Right
    + Closest
    
* Explore the correlation between A and B
