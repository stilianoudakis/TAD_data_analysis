**Background.** Studies using chromosome conformation capture techniques have shown that the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome is folded into distinct compartments, known as topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs serve as units of coordinated gene expression where regulatory elements tend to interact more frequently. The location of TAD boundaries is highly conserved, suggesting the presence of epigenomic marks aiding in TAD formation. The ability to predict which epigenomic features are most associated with the TAD boundaries will allow us to further understand the regulatory role of the 3D structure of the genome. 

**Methods.** Few methods have been developed to model and predict the association between epigenomic features and the TAD boundaries. However, many widely used models ignore key characteristics of the data that may hinder the performance of certain parametric models. Specifically, the number of TAD boundaries is much less than the number of other genomic regions, leading to heavily imbalanced classes. Furthermore, most methods utilize direct overlap as a means to quantify the association, while distance, the measure of spatial relationships, remains unaccounted for. Consequently, distance on genomic scale vary widely, leaving uncertainty how the heavily right-tailed distribution of distance measures will affect model's performance. We propose a novel data pre-processing pipeline that addresses those questions. It includes a nonparametric random forest model ... [??? Continue]

**Results.** It was found that the random forest model, when applied to pre-processed data, out performed multiple logistic regression models, with and without LASSO-regularized coefficients. Likewise, the variable importance of the random forest yielded more stable results compared to the coefficients of the multiple logistic regression models.

**Conclusions.**
